### **_About me:_**

I am 30 years old. I am an engeneer. For a long time I was interested in how websites are created and work on the Internet. At first I got interested in the issue of website design. I took web design courses and learned a lot of new, interesting things. I also studied various programs for creating design, such as: photoshop, illustrator, indesign, figma, blender, 3ds max. Now I want to know how the site works "under the hood" of a beautiful picture.
